### App overview

Social Bee is an app that allows users to create activity clubs and organise events. This web app is targeted towards local communities to help them find common interest and collaborate together.

The frontend of the app is made with React.js and Python, MySQL on the backend. The app utilises the Dark Skies API to give real time weather reports for the date and location of the event and City Mapper to give direction and estimated journey time from user's location to the event.


### App Instructions
Home Page - the home page will display set of carousel images that portray our app/brand messages, followed by search bars and list of upcoming events.

## Process
This was a paired project with one other developer and we managed our workload by running sprint session every morning and at the end of the day. We used Trello to prioritise and delegate work, keep a track of our progress and Slack to communicate while working remotely. Features were prioritised using the MoSCoW method and were created on separate git branches before being merged into the development branch.

## Back End
First step for the project was to work on how to structure and create relationship on PostgreSQL database. As we were both new to Python and SQL database we pair coded to establish relationships diagrams (ERDs) for the database.
We decided on

* one-to-many users and clubs
* one-to-many users and events
* one-to-one relationships between comments and clubs
* many-to-many between attendees and events
* many-to-many between followers and clubs

Once we finalised the data structure we had to figure out how to join tables. We referred to the docs and  were able to implement attending and following functionality associated with 'Events' and 'Clubs'. From here, we moved on to creating backend functionality and tested all relationship in Insomnia and fixed any bugs.  

## Front End
With backend up and running we produced wireframes for the layout of our users journey on the frontend. This later was useful when we started adding key features on front end. 

### Challenges
The main challenge on this project was to build follow, comment features and to create relationships between models/tables in MySQL Database. SQL database was new to us and the therefore creating and managing the database took a lot of time planning and figuring out as we were trying to make it work.

### Wins



## Future features
Some extra features that I wouldâ€™ve loved on the app are
* A Calendar and push notification when users receive a message.
* Search functionality with date
