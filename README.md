### App overview

Social Bee is an app that allows users to create activity clubs and organise events. This web app is targeted towards local communities to help them find common interest and do it together.

The app utilises the Dark Skies API to give real time weather reports for the date and location of the event and City Mapper to give direction and estimated journey time from user's location to the event.


### App Instructions
Home Page - the home page will display set of carousel images that portray our app/brand messages, followed by search bars and list of upcoming events ordered by the date.

## Process
First step for the project was to work on how to structure and create relationship on MySQL database. Once we finalised the data structure we moved on to wireframe and basic structure of the frontend.

This was a paired project with one other developer and we managed our workload by running sprint session every morning and at the end of the day. We used Trello to prioritise and delegate work, keep a track of our progress and Slack to communicate while working remotely. Features were prioritised using the MoSCoW method. Features were created on separate git branches before being merged into the development branch.


### Challenges
The main challenge on this project was to build follow, comment features and to create relationships between models/tables in MySQL Database. SQL database was new to us and the therefore creating and managing the database took a lot of time planning and figuring out as we were trying to make it work.

### Wins



## Future features
Some extra features that I wouldâ€™ve loved on the app is a calendar and push notification when users receive a message.
