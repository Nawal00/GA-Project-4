You can find a hosted version here https://social-bee.herokuapp.com/

### App overview

Social Bee is an app that allows users to create activity clubs and organise events. This web app is targeted towards local communities to help them find common interest and collaborate together.

The frontend of the app is made with React.js and Python, MySQL on the backend. The app utilises the Dark Skies API to give real time weather reports for the date and location of the event and City Mapper to give direction and estimated journey time from user's location to the event.


### App Instructions
1. Home Page - The home page displays a set of carousel images that portray our app/brand messages, followed by search bars and list of upcoming events.

2. Event Show - The event show page will show date of the event, weather on the date, estimated journey time from user current location and city mapper or google maps directions to the event.

3. Club Index - The clubs index page is a list of specific clubs i.e. badminton club, mums breakfast club, gamers club.

4. Club Show - The clubs show page includes the club's upcoming events, past events, members and if the user follows the club then the chat feature will also be accessible.

5. User Page - The user pages shows future and past events that the user is attending as well as the clubs they follow and events they've created.

## Process
This was a paired project with one other developer and we managed our workload by running sprint session every morning and at the end of the day. We used Trello to prioritise and delegate work, keep a track of our progress and Slack to communicate while working remotely. Features were prioritised using the MoSCoW method and were created on separate git branches before being merged into the development branch.

### Backend
First step of this project was to work on how to structure and create relationship on PostgreSQL database. As we were both new to Python and SQL database we pair coded to establish relationships diagrams (ERDs) for the database.
We decided on following models,

* one-to-many users and clubs
* one-to-many users and events
* one-to-one relationships between comments and clubs
* many-to-many between attendees and events
* many-to-many between followers and clubs

Once we finalised the data structure we had to figure out how to join tables. We referred to the docs and  were able to implement attending and following functionality associated with 'Events' and 'Clubs'. From here, we moved on to creating backend functionality and tested all relationship in Insomnia and fixed any bugs.  

### Frontend
With backend up and running, we produced wireframes for the layout of our users journey on the frontend. This later was useful to maintain consistency with the design while adding features and styling. I created Home Page, Events Show Page, Clubs Index Page, Clubs Show page, Registration forms, Loading screen and helped with style fixes on other pages. The site was styled with Bulma CSS Framework but heavily customised with SCSS, so that the site has its own look and feel and is consistent with the overall branding.

One of the requirement for this project was to test a functional and classical React component which I was responsible for. For testing on React Components on frontend I used Enzyme, Mocha and Chai. We then set up JSDOM, so that we can run front-end tests that output to the terminal. To test the EventsCard, a functional component, we used Enzyme to check that the correct DOM elements have been rendered along with the props to check that it renders any data correctly. To test the Events Show page, a classical component, we used Enzyme's mount method, and Sinon to create a fake Axios request. This allowed us to check that the data being stored in state was accurate and being rendered correctly.

### Challenges
The main challenge on this project was to build follow, comment features and to create relationships (ERD) between models/tables in MySQL Database. SQL database was new to us and the therefore creating and managing the database took a lot of time planning, reading documentation and figuring out as we were trying to make it work.

### Wins
I am very pleased with how the site turned out and how well we worked together as a team. We reached a solid MVP state which then allowed us to explore external APIs to enhance our app features. We looked into DarkSky API and managed to incorporate it on our app to give user real time weather report on the day of the event. Additionally, we utilised City Mapper API to present user with estimated journey time to the event.

I am particularly proud of the code below that takes address from the new 'Event' form, converts it into lan and lat which is used by Mapbox API to display the location on the map.

## Future features
Some extra features that I wouldâ€™ve loved on the app are
* Push notification when users receive a message.
* Search functionality according to dates.
* Plugins to add events to users calendars
* A latest events feed pages for the users would be another way to discover the upcoming events.
