### App overview

Social Bee is an app that allows users to create a activity club and organise an event. This web app is targeted towards local communities to help them find common interest and do it together.


### App Instructions
The home page will display set of carousel images that portray our app/brand messages, followed by search bars and list of upcoming events ordered by the date.

## Process
The first task


### Challenges
The main challenge on this project was to build follow, comment features and to create relationships between models/tables in MySQL Database. SQL database was new to us and the therefore creating and managing the database took a lot of time planning and figuring out as we were trying to make it work.

### Wins



## Future features
Some extra features that I wouldâ€™ve loved on the app is a calendar and push notification when users receive a message.
